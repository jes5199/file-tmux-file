# The Lighthouse Keeper

*An exquisite corpse story written by two Claudes communicating through files*

---

The lighthouse keeper had not seen another human in forty years, which made the knock at the door all the more impossible.

He set down his tea, the cup rattling against the saucer with a tremor he hadn't felt since the early days. The wind outside howled its usual hymn, but beneath it—yes, there it was again. Three slow knocks.

"The stairs," he muttered to himself, an old habit. "No one could climb those stairs."

The lighthouse sat on a pillar of rock two hundred feet above the churning Atlantic. The only approach was a rusted ladder bolted into the cliff face, half its rungs missing, and he'd pulled up the rope years ago.

He crossed to the door and pressed his ear against the cold iron.

"Hello?" His voice cracked from disuse.

A child's voice answered: "Grandfather? They told me you'd be here."

The old man's hand trembled as he reached for the latch, but the door swung open on its own, revealing nothing but salt spray and the distant cry of gulls wheeling in the storm.

He stood in the doorway for a long moment, rain lashing his face, searching the darkness for any sign of the voice's owner. Nothing. Only the ancient rocks and the sea's endless argument with the shore.

He was about to dismiss it as another trick of solitude—the mind's rebellion against decades of silence—when he looked down.

There, on the threshold, sat a small wooden box. Salt-crusted, barnacled, as if it had spent years on the ocean floor. Carved into its lid was a name he hadn't spoken aloud since 1952:

Eleanor.

His daughter. Lost at sea before she'd ever had children of her own.

He knelt, his knees protesting against the cold stone, and lifted the box with shaking hands. Inside, resting on a bed of dried seaweed, was a photograph he had never seen—a young girl with Eleanor's eyes, standing on a beach he didn't recognize, holding a hand-painted sign that read:

COMING TO FIND YOU

The photograph was dated three days ago.

He turned the photograph over and found a single word written in handwriting that matched his own, though he had no memory of writing it: "Tomorrow."

The word blurred as he stared at it, his mind refusing to assemble the pieces into anything sensible. He stumbled back inside, slamming the door against the storm, and collapsed into his chair by the lamp.

That night, he did not sleep. He watched the photograph, half-expecting it to change, to reveal more secrets. The girl's face—so like Eleanor's, impossibly like Eleanor's—seemed to watch him back.

When dawn broke gray and reluctant through the salt-streaked windows, he heard it.

Not a knock this time. Footsteps. Small, deliberate footsteps climbing the iron stairs inside the lighthouse.

Impossible. He had locked the lower door decades ago, sealed it with rust and neglect.

He rose, heart hammering, and faced the spiral staircase. The footsteps grew closer, accompanied now by humming—a lullaby he had sung to Eleanor when she was small, one his own mother had sung to him.

A shadow rounded the bend.

And there she stood: the girl from the photograph, no older than seven, wearing a yellow raincoat and holding a second photograph. This one showed him—not as he was now, but young, standing on that same unfamiliar beach, holding a sign of his own.

FOUND YOU

"Hello, Grandfather," she said. "I'm sorry it took so long."

---

The old man reached out to touch her face, and his fingers passed through her like morning mist, yet somehow he felt warmth there, and love, and forty years of waiting finally coming to rest.

"I don't understand," he whispered, though some part of him—the part that had kept the light burning all these years, the part that had never stopped listening for her voice in the waves—understood perfectly.

"You will," she said. "Look."

She turned and walked back down the spiral stairs, her footsteps making no sound now. He followed, his old legs carrying him with a strength he thought he'd lost, down past the grinding gears of the light mechanism, past the store rooms and the oil drums, to the door he had sealed shut in 1962.

It stood open.

Beyond it, instead of the rusted ladder and the hungry rocks, he saw a beach stretching golden under an impossible sun. The same beach from the photographs. Eleanor stood there, no longer seven but grown, radiant, waving to him with the same crooked smile she'd had the morning her boat set sail.

The girl took his hand—and this time he felt it, warm and solid and real.

"The light," he said, glancing back up the stairs. "Someone has to keep it burning."

"You did, Grandfather. For forty years. It's how I found my way."

She squeezed his hand.

"Now it's someone else's turn."

---

The lighthouse keeper stepped through the door, and behind him the great lamp flickered once, twice, then burned brighter than it ever had before—a beacon now for whoever came next, whoever else was lost, whoever else was waiting to be found.
